I am going to need:

[xxxx] lay out the HTML including table

[xxxx] 5 input fields and a submit button

[xx] Engage event listener to button,
[xxx]use Button to pass the inputs of these fields into jQuery

[xxx] These inputs will need to feed an object Constructor

[xxx] The object constructor should push to an array

I should have a function that loop through the array and pushes each attribute
of an object to a table

The table should be appended with each submit

When a new employee is added the fields must clear

There should be a running total of the .annualSalary attribute
This total should be updated upon submitClick

I will need an if/else to see if total of all annualSalaries is greater than 20,000
- if it is, CSS styes must be changed to a red background

~~~~~~~~~~~~
FOR HARD MODE
an additional button will need to be added to the table to delete (i.e. hide) an employee
